android-latitude-longitude-picker
=================================

Android code that opens a location picker in your app, and returns a Location object. (For the time being it will be just a wrapper for the jQuery lat-lng picker project here: https://github.com/wimagguc/jquery-latitude-longitude-picker-gmaps)
